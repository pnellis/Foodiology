# Foodiology_Test

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Introduction
FoodiologyRecipes.com is a web application to provide users with a community to share and search for recipes. To be able to like, post, and comment on recipes, and save ingredients to the pantry you must create an account. However, all users (with or without an account) are able to search for recipes based on ingredients they input directly into the search bar. 

## Purpose
Foodiologyrecipes.com is great for individuals who have a variety of ingredients, but donâ€™t know what to cook using them. Our website provides a platform for people to input their ingredients, select a preferred cuisine type, time needed to prepare, servings yield, and meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, beverage, dessert). 

## Key Features

* **Search Recipes** search recipes based on ingredients you input, preferred cuisine type, time needed to prepare, servings yield, and meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, beverage, dessert)
* **Create an Account** create an account (email verification needed)
